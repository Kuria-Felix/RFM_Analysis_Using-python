 RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns.
 
 
 ### **Step 1: Importing the Required Libraries**
#importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
 #calculate the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values of the customers to move further:

### ** Step 2: Loading and Preparing the Data**
Next, we need to load and prepare the data for RFM analysis.


data = pd.read_csv("input/rfmpracticedata/rfm_data(1).csv")
print(data.head())

### **Step 3: Calculating RFM Metrics**
 #let's move forward and calculate the RFM metrics for each customer. By utilizing a range of functions and operations, we will determine
#the recency, frequency, and monetary value scores. 

### **Step 4: Assigning RFM Scores**
'''in this step, we will assign scores to the recency, frequency, and monetary value metrics, allowing us to evaluate and categorize customers 
#based on their purchasing behavior.

### **step 5: RFM Value Segmentation**

#Now letâ€™s calculate the final RFM score and the value segment according to the scores:
